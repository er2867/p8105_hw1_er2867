##Problem 1
##A random sample of size 10 from a uniform[0, 5] distribution
prblm1 <-data.frame
  set.seed (504123)
  x=(rdunif(10, 5, 0))
  table(x)
#A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2
  z <- "logicalvec"  
  is.logical(z)
   as.logical (x[x > 2])
# A (length-10) character vector
 a <- "abcdefghij"
 is.character(a)
 nchar (a)
#A (length-10) factor vector
 degree <- factor(c("mailmanmph"))
# Try to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe
  mean (x)
  mean (degree)
  mean (z)
  mean (a)
#Only the mean of x and z can be taken, as they are the only numeric    #variables
#Write a code chunk that applies the as.numeric function to the        logical, character, and factor variables (please show this chunk     but not the output)
  as.numeric (degree)
  as.numeric (a)
  as.numeric (z)
#convert your character variable from character to factor to numeric; similarly, convert your factor variable from factor to character to numeric. 
```
```{r}
##Problem 2
prblm2 <-data.frame
#x: a random sample of size 1000 from a standard Normal distribution
  set.seed (1234)
  x <- rnorm(1000)
#y: a random sample of size 1000 from a standard Normal distribution
  y <- rnorm(1000)
#z: A logical vector indicating whether the x + y > 0
  z <- "logicalvec"  
  is.logical(z)
  logical (length = 0)
  as.logical(x + y > 0)
#A numeric vector created by coercing the above logical vector
    as.numeric (x + y > 0)
#A factor vector created by coercing the above logical vector
  as.factor(x + y > 0)
#size of dataset
  dataset1 <- data.frame(x,y, rep = TRUE)
  dim (dataset)
# the mean and median of x
  mean(x)
  median (x)
#Make a scatterplot of y vs x 
ggplot(dataset1, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point()
